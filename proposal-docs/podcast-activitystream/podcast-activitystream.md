# The Podcast ActivityStream

> Version 1.0 by Yassine Doghri - 2021.04.15

The document aims to explain through examples and namespace definition how the existing RSS specification could be interfaced to [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).

This is meant as a complementary work to the existing [RSS podcast namespace specification](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace) whilst unlocking features offered by the ActivityPub protocol.

## Context

A Podcast show is essentially constituted of two entities. In the RSS specification, these are placed under the `<channel>` and `<item>` tags. The `<channel>`, referring to the Podcast, may include multiple `<item>` tags which are the Podcast episodes.

[The ActivityPub protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub) is a decentralized social networking protocol based upon the [ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) data format. This offers a base vocabulary for social interactions between decentralized servers and allows us to extend it for podcasting.

The syntax for defining the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format is called [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), a method of encoding linked data using JSON.

Just as the RSS specification, the **Podcast ActivityStream** defines two entities:

- [Podcast Actor](#the-podcast-object)
- [PodcastEpisode Object](#the-podcastepisode-object).

## The Podcast Actor

The Podcast Actor extends the [Actor Object](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#actors) from ActivityPub to include specific podcast attributes.

Here is an example of a Podcast Actor:

  }
}
```

### Notes about the attributes

- `publisher` corresponds to the `author` tag in the [itunes RSS spec](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390).
- `discoverable` defines whether or not the podcast (or episode) should be visible on other platforms. Corresponds to the `block` tag in the itunes RSS spec.
- `complete` whether or not the podcast show is over (no more new episodes to be expected).
- `movedTo` corresponds to the `new-feed-url` tag in the rss feed. Adopted by Mastodon though not an officially.

## The PodcastEpisode Object

The PodcastEpisode Object extends the base [Object type](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-object) from ActivityPub to include all attributes specific to a podcast episode. It also includes an extended [Audio Object](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-audio) for the podcast episode's audio file.

Here is an example of a PodcastEpisode Object:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://podcast.org/ns"
  ],
  "type": "PodcastEpisode",
  "id": "https://podcast.demo/podcasts/DemoPodcast/episodes/example-episode",

    "content": "Here is the description for the **demo episode**!",
    "contentMap": {
      "en": "<p>Here is the description for the <strong>demo episode</strong>!</p>",
      "fr": "<p>Voici la description pour la <strong>démo de l’épisode</strong> !</p>"

```

## The JSON-LD namespace definition

The [ActivityStreams base vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) was extended to create [The Podcast JSON-LD namespace](./podcast-jsonld-namespace.md)

## Going further

The JSON-LD syntax offers a wide range of features that go beyond the RSS file: direct social interaction, pagination, translations, etc.

You can check out the [examples folder](./examples) to get a glimpse into the possibilities of ActivityPub.
